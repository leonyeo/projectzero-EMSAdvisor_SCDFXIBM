## Short description

### What's the problem?

Part of the World Health Organization's guidance on limiting further spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by closing their facilities. With school-aged children at home for an indeterminate amount of time,  keeping them engaged, entertained, and on top of their education is important.

### How can technology help?

Schools and teachers can continue to engage with their students through virtual classrooms, and even create interactive spaces for classes. As parents face a new situation where they may need to homeschool their children, finding appropriate online resources is important as well.

### The idea

It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads an image.
2. IBM Cloud Annotations model classifies and identifies image features.
3. The user can answer additional question for a more accurate diagnosis.
4. The site displays instructions for responding to the situation.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install the latest version of Node at [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

`git clone` the repo and `cd` into it by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leonyeo/projectzero-EMSAdvisor_SCDFXIBM.git
cd projectzero-EMSAdvisor_SCDFXIBM
```

### Installing

```bash
npm install
```

> **Note: Youâ€™ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine.** You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

### Run the App

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
You can also view it on your mobile browser by accessing the IP address provided in the cmd line.

## Live demo

You can find a running system to test at []()
